Coding Assignment for Java
=========================
Spring Boot / Java 8+ / Gradle / HSQL / application that is used to find long running log events.

***

Run steps:
-----------
1. Clone this repository
2. Run in console `./gradlew bootJar`, `java -jar build/libs/margo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar filePath`
4. Check `eventdb.log` file to verify results

Testing Instructions
--------------------

The file should have the following format:

```
{"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"STARTED", "type":"APPLICATION_LOG", "host":"12345", "timestamp":1491377495212}
{"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495213}
{"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495218}
{"id":"scsmbstgra", "state":"FINISHED", "type":"APPLICATION_LOG", "host":"12345", "timestamp":1491377495217}
{"id":"scsmbstgrc", "state":"STARTED", "timestamp":1491377495210}
{"id":"scsmbstgrb", "state":"FINISHED", "timestamp":1491377495216}
```

Every line in the file is a JSON object containing event data:

- **id**: the unique event identifier
- **state**: whether the event was started or finished (can have values "STARTED" or "FINISHED" timestamp)
- **timestamp**: the timestamp of the event in milliseconds
- **host**: hostname (optional)
- **type**: type of log (optional)

This log file is supposed to be created by a server which logs different events to it.
Every event has 2 entries in a log:
- one entry when the event was started
- another when the event was finished.

The entries in a log file have no specific order (it can occur that a specific event is logged before the event starts)

In the example above, the event scsmbstgrb duration is 1401377495216 - 1491377495213 = 3ms The longest event is scsmbstgrc (1491377495218 - 1491377495210 = 8ms)

The application:

- Takes the input file path as input argument
- Flags any long events that take longer than 4ms with a column in the database called "alert" Write the found event details to file-based HSQLDB (http://hsqldb.org/) in the working folder
- Creates a new table if necessary and enter the following values:
    * Event id
    * Event duration
    * Type and Host if applicable d. "alert" set to True if applicable
